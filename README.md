## Install

    git clone https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles.git
    source dotfiles/install.sh

Just re-run `source install.sh` to update.

## OS X Defaults

    source osxdefaults.sh

## Warning

If you would use or fork this, you'll want to put at least `user.name`, `user.email` in `~/.gitconfig.user`.

Any file in the `system/` folder will be evaluated when starting a terminal session, so that's where customizations like paths, functions, and aliases go.
