# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

It mainly targets macOS systems (should install on e.g. Ubuntu as well for many tools, config and aliases etc).

## Highlights

- Minimal efforts to install everything, using a [Makefile](./Makefile)
- Mostly based around Homebrew, Caskroom and Node.js, latest Bash + GNU Utils
- Great [Window management](./config/hammerspoon/README.md) (using Hammerspoon)
- Fast and colored prompt
- Updated macOS defaults
- Well-organized and easy to customize
- The installation and runcom setup is
  [tested weekly on real Ubuntu and macOS machines](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/actions)
  (Big Sur/11, Monterey/12 and Ventura/13) using [a GitHub Action](./.github/workflows/dotfiles-installation.yml)
- Supports both Apple Silicon (M1) and Intel chips

## Packages Overview

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (packages: [Brewfile](./install/Brewfile))
- [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) (packages: [Caskfile](./install/Caskfile))
- [Node.js + npm LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (packages: [npmfile](./install/npmfile))
- Latest Git, Bash, Python, GNU coreutils, curl, Ruby
- [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) (config: [keybindings & window management](./config/hammerspoon))
- [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) (sync application settings)
- `$EDITOR` is [GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) (`$VISUAL` is `code` and Git `core.editor` is `code --wait`)

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

1. Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

This will clone or download this repo to `~/.dotfiles` (depending on the availability of `git`, `curl` or `wget`).

1. Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install the [packages listed above](#packages-overview), and symlink
   [runcom](./runcom) and [config](./config) files (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```

Running `make` with the Makefile is idempotent. The installation process in the Makefile is tested on every push and every week in this
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/actions). Please file an issue in this repo if there are errors.

## Post-Installation

- `dot dock` (set [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh))
- `dot macos` (set [macOS defaults](./macos/defaults.sh))
- Mackup
  - Log in to Dropbox (and wait until synced)
  - `cd && ln -s ~/.config/mackup/.mackup.cfg ~`
  - `mackup restore`
- Start `Hammerspoon` once and set "Launch Hammerspoon at login"
- `touch ~/.dotfiles/system/.exports` and populate this file with tokens (e.g. `export GITHUB_TOKEN=abc`)

## The `dot` command

```
$ dot help
Usage: dot <command>

   clean            Clean up caches (brew, cargo, gem, pip)
