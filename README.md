# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

Mainly targets macOS systems, but works on Ubuntu and Arch Linux as well.

## Highlights

- Minimal efforts to install everything, using a [Makefile](./Makefile)
- Mostly based around Homebrew, Caskroom and Node.js, latest Bash + GNU Utils
- Fast and colored prompt
- Updated macOS defaults
- Well-organized and easy to customize
- The installation and runcom setup is
  [tested weekly on real Ubuntu and macOS machines](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/actions)
  (Ventura/13, Sonomo/14, Sequoia/15) using [a GitHub Action](./.github/workflows/dotfiles-installation.yml)
- Supports both Apple Silicon (M1) and Intel chips

## Packages Overview

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (packages: [Brewfile](./install/Brewfile))
- [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) (packages: [Caskfile](./install/Caskfile))
- [Node.js + npm LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (packages: [npmfile](./install/npmfile))
- Latest Git, Bash, Python, GNU coreutils, curl, Ruby
- Editors: VS Code and nano (`EDITOR`, `VISUAL` and Git `core.editor`)

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

1. Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

This will clone or download this repo to `~/.dotfiles` (depending on the availability of `git`, `curl` or `wget`).

1. Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install the [packages listed above](#packages-overview), and symlink
   [runcom](./runcom) and [config](./config) files (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```

Running `make` with the Makefile is idempotent. The installation process in the Makefile is tested on every push and every week in this
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/actions). Please file an issue in this repo if there are errors.

## Post-Installation

1. Set your Git credentials:

```sh
git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global github.user "your-github-username"
```

2. Set macOS [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh) and [system defaults](./macos/defaults.sh):

```sh
dot dock
dot macos
```

3. Populate this file with tokens (example: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=abc`):

```sh
touch ~/.dotfiles/system/.exports
```

## The `dot` command

```
$ dot help
Usage: dot <command>

Commands:
   clean            Clean up caches (brew, cargo, gem, pip)
   dock             Apply macOS Dock settings
   edit             Open dotfiles in IDE ($VISUAL) and Git GUI ($VISUAL_GIT)
